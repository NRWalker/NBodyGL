V 1.0

This program creates a solar system and uses Newton's Law of gravitation to animate motion. It allows the user to manipulate and explore the system at will.

Requires:

	OpenGL - a graphics library
	numpy - a math library
	
Features:

	Gravitation between multiple astrological objects
	Adding and subtracting objects from the system
	Camera rotation about the center of the system with keyboard input
	Scene traversal with keyboard input
	Scene traversal with mouse input
	
Future Features:
	
	Eccentricity in orbits
	More variation in mass and density
	Better collisions (debris)
	Larger systems
	Generation of high speed, high mass external astrological objects
	N number of stars
	Coloring
	Texturing
	Lighting control
	Bugfixes for movement
	Smoother motion
